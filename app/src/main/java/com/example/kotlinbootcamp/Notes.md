HIGHLIGHTS ON BOOTCAMP

Kotlin is maintained by Intellij team. It's similar to Swift

- Com means company
```kotlin
snake_case // generally used in DB
kebap-case
camelCase // variable names
PascalCase // Class Names
```
- in Swift corresponding value of $ is /0 .
- val, var, let, final
- Variables declared with val are read-only or immutable.
- >= => in kotlin, <= >= in javascript because -> and => signs are reserved words in both languages.
- lambda expressions???

_switch-case structure_
````kotlin
    when(expression){
        1 -> {} // switch-case-break-default
        2 -> {}
        else -> {}
    }

    switch(){ // in other languages
        case 0: {}
        break;
        case1: {}
        break;
        default: {}
        break;
    }
